# Discover Overview

The **Discover Assessment** is a fast, structured way to understand a business. In just 15–20 minutes, it looks at a company across [**18 Value Drivers**]({{ '/key-lessons/18-value-drivers' | absolute_url }}) and compares the results to decades of proven benchmarks.

The outcome is a clear report that shows what the business is worth today, what it could be worth, and the steps needed to close that gap. Along the way, it highlights risks to address and opportunities to pursue.

## Why It Matters

For **business owners**, Discover provides an immediate snapshot of enterprise value and shines a light on the areas that matter most for growth. It frames the business as an asset and points to actions that can increase long-term return.

For **advisors**, Discover is a practical way to deliver instant value in conversations with clients and prospects. It helps create trust, uncovers meaningful opportunities, and establishes a foundation for longer-term advisory work.

## How It Works

Discover is built around a simple process:

1. You answer 22 guided questions about the business.
2. The system compares responses against more than 40 years of private business best practices.
3. A report is generated that translates the data into clear, actionable insights.

It’s quick to complete, but backed by rigorous standards first developed at MIT and reviewed by leading valuation experts.

## What You Get

The report covers the essentials:

- **Enterprise Value** — what the business is worth today.
- **Potential Value** — what it could be worth if key improvements are made.
- **Value Gap** — the difference between today and potential.
- **Top Opportunities** — the three areas with the biggest growth impact.
- **Risks** — vulnerabilities that could undermine value if left unaddressed.

# 18 Value Drivers

## Two types of Drivers 
The Drivers are broken into two types: Market Drivers and Operational Drivers. This way we ensure the most holistic approach to viewing the business from every angle. 

## The Market Drivers 
It may be helpful to think of these drivers as ‘external’. Market drivers often relate to how your business operates compared to others in the same industry. Think of these drivers as they relate to sales, your product, your competition, and external factors. While these external forces may be out of your control, the more you are aware of them the more compelling your business will be. 

## The Operational Drivers 
These drivers relate to all of the factors within your business. They are sometime referred to as the ‘internal’ drivers. While most business owners tend to naturally focus on these drivers when running the business, they are also some of the most elusive. 

These drivers rarely present themselves in obvious manners and most pose difficulties even when you have a team who is responsible. Most business owners are not surprise when one of these drivers pops up as a top Value Gap issue.

## The 18 Value Drivers
### Growth

Growth measures how a company increases top-line revenue over time. This includes tracking historical trends, understanding external and internal factors, and identifying opportunities such as cross-sells, upsells, and remarketing. Growth must be documented clearly so trends can be spotted and planned for.

Indicators of strong growth include evidence that the company has expanded faster than competitors, that the broader industry or niche is also expanding, and that customer demand supports future growth.

### Large Potential Market

A large potential market increases the number of opportunities available to a business. The focus is on the size of the audience, not geographic reach. Companies must determine how much room remains for expansion, identify market fragmentation or consolidation, and use reliable industry data to track trends.

Key considerations include whether customers see a clear advantage in your offering, whether competitors are exiting or consolidating, and whether new product or territory expansion is realistic. A company that understands its potential market can plan growth more effectively.

### Dominant Market Share

Dominant market share describes how much of a defined market the company controls compared to competitors. To measure this, a company must clearly define its market, know its position within it, and communicate why it can maintain or grow that share.

Indicators include a documented definition of the market, quantifiable evidence of being the leading competitor, and a clear explanation of how dominance will be sustained. This driver highlights stability and competitive strength within a specific segment.

### Recurring Revenue

Recurring revenue refers to the extent to which a company can count on future income. It may come from contracts, subscriptions, leases, or strong customer loyalty programs. The more predictable and diversified the revenue, the more valuable the company becomes.

Strong recurring revenue is supported by three elements: contracts that formalize ongoing sales, a balanced mix of customers at different stages, and clear reasons why customers continue to buy. This driver demonstrates stability and reduces reliance on single, one-time transactions.

### Barriers to Entry

Barriers to entry protect a company from new competitors. These can be legal protections such as patents, trademarks, or copyrights; market protections such as strong brand or exclusive agreements; or capital requirements that make entry costly.

A strong position requires documenting these barriers and showing how they are defended. Without them, new competitors can easily copy the business model. With them, the company’s position becomes harder to challenge and more secure over time.

### Product Differentiation

Product differentiation shows how a company’s offering is distinct from competitors. This can be based on features, service quality, design, or other unique attributes that customers value. A company must be able to explain and prove why its product or service is different.

Differentiation should also account for lifecycle stage and financial outcomes, such as pricing power or higher margins. Companies that establish a clear identity within their market are less vulnerable to imitation and can sustain a stronger competitive position.

### Brand

Brand measures how recognizable and trusted a company is in its market. A strong brand has consistent identity across products, services, and communication channels. It conveys specific qualities that customers associate with the company.

Effective brands improve customer acquisition, retention, and pricing power. Even if a brand is not a household name, clarity and consistency of message are essential. Branding should be reviewed regularly to ensure it reflects the company’s goals and remains relevant to its audience.

### Margin Advantage

Margin advantage shows how efficiently a company generates profit compared to competitors. Gross and net margins must be measured against industry averages to determine whether the company operates at an advantage or disadvantage.

High margins improve value, but they must also be sustainable. Companies should track trends, identify causes of shifts, and maintain processes to improve margins over time. The ability to consistently show stronger margins than peers signals operational strength.

### Customer Diversification

Customer diversification reduces risk by spreading revenue across multiple clients and segments. A concentrated customer base leaves the business exposed if one or two accounts leave.

A well-diversified company shows that no single customer represents more than 20% of revenue and can demonstrate progress toward broadening its base. This driver also supports growth by applying existing solutions to new markets or industries.

### Company Overview

A clear company overview ensures that employees, customers, and partners understand who the company is, what it does, and where it is going. Every employee should be able to give a concise explanation of the company’s purpose and direction.

Supporting elements include a documented profile, a consistent company story, a professional web presence, defined market understanding, competitive knowledge, and a strategic plan aligned with owner goals. A business that is simple to explain is easier to trust and evaluate.

### Finance

Finance evaluates whether a company has accurate, consistent, and useful financial information. This includes audited statements, operating reports, tax compliance, and clear documentation of both tangible and intangible assets.

Companies with strong finance processes can communicate performance effectively, make better decisions, and access outside capital more easily. Weak financial discipline reduces value by creating uncertainty about the company’s stability and results.

### Sales & Marketing

Sales and marketing measure how effectively a company attracts and converts customers. This requires a defined marketing plan, clear sales process, documented objectives, and consistent measurement of results.

When aligned, sales and marketing reinforce each other. Research drives strategy, messaging reflects customer needs, and performance metrics ensure accountability. Without these systems, customer acquisition and retention depend too heavily on individual employees.

### Operations

Operations assess whether a company can consistently deliver on promises. This includes documented processes, measurable performance objectives, compliance with industry standards, and written supplier agreements.

Clear operations reduce dependency on individuals and make it possible for outsiders to understand how the business runs. Weak operations often create hidden risks that undermine value. Strong operations ensure reliability, scalability, and smoother transitions.

### Customer Satisfaction

Customer satisfaction evaluates how well a company meets and maintains customer expectations. It should be tracked systematically using metrics such as Net Promoter Score or Customer Satisfaction Index.

Satisfied customers are more likely to return, recommend, and remain loyal. Tracking positive and negative experiences helps identify what to replicate and what to fix. Businesses that measure and act on satisfaction data build stronger long-term value.

### Senior Management

Senior management measures the depth and effectiveness of leadership beyond the owner. Clear roles, strong teamwork, competitive compensation, and succession planning all contribute to higher value.

A company that runs smoothly without daily owner involvement is more resilient. Investors and buyers favor businesses with established leadership teams that can continue executing strategy even if the owner steps away.

### Human Resources

Human resources ensure that the company manages people effectively with clear processes. This includes recruitment, employee contracts, policies, and compensation structures. Documentation and defined responsibilities reduce confusion and increase productivity.

Strong HR practices improve retention, compliance, and culture. Treating HR with the same operational rigor as other departments ensures stability and scalability as the business grows.

### Legal

Legal readiness protects against risks that can reduce company value. This involves having contracts with key parties, agreements with investors, and insurance coverage for liability. A documented process for handling legal issues is also required.

Companies with strong legal structures face fewer surprises and demonstrate reliability to buyers and investors. Weak legal practices increase exposure to lawsuits, disputes, or compliance failures that can derail operations.

### Innovation

Innovation measures a company’s ability to create and implement new ideas that drive advantage. It requires a culture that encourages experimentation, a process to capture and test ideas, and metrics to track outcomes.

Innovation can involve new products, services, or internal efficiencies. Companies that innovate deliberately remain competitive, adapt to market changes, and secure long-term growth. Those without innovation processes risk stagnation and eventual decline.

# 18 Value Drivers

## Two types of Drivers 
The Drivers are broken into two types: Market Drivers and Operational Drivers. This way we ensure the most holistic approach to viewing the business from every angle. 

## The Market Drivers 
It may be helpful to think of these drivers as ‘external’. Market drivers often relate to how your business operates compared to others in the same industry. Think of these drivers as they relate to sales, your product, your competition, and external factors. While these external forces may be out of your control, the more you are aware of them the more compelling your business will be. 

## The Operational Drivers 
These drivers relate to all of the factors within your business. They are sometime referred to as the ‘internal’ drivers. While most business owners tend to naturally focus on these drivers when running the business, they are also some of the most elusive. These drivers rarely present themselves in obvious manners and most pose difficulties even when you have a team who is responsible. Most business owners are not surprise when one of these drivers pops up as a top Value Gap issue.
